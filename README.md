# Programming2-Projects
This repository is for the projects I am currently working at the University of Kansas.
This repository will be using C++ to implement these projects.

McCumber-Lab-1 will use Class defining and object creation, arrays of objects, and file I/O.
The goal of this project is to allow a user to interact with a long list of boardgames. The user should be able to look at all the games at once. Print the game of the rank the user chooses. Also where the people and my professors ratings differ.
